# 💬 Real‑Time Chat Application in Python

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

A simple **client‑server** chat application built from scratch in Python using the `socket` and `threading` modules. It supports two‑way, real‑time messaging in the terminal and demonstrates core networking and concurrency concepts.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Fundamental socket programming (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, bind, listen, accept, connect).

- Multithreading in Python and thread lifecycle (start(), join()).

- Handling I/O‑bound tasks concurrently despite the GIL.

- Graceful error handling (using try/except) in network code.

- Debugging real‑world issues: thread start/join errors, port conflicts, Git branch problems.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- ✅ Multi‑client support (broadcast to all clients).

- ✅ Message history storage (e.g., in a file or database).

- ✅ GUI front‑end (Tkinter, PyQt, or web-based with Flask + WebSockets).

- ✅ Encryption using SSL/TLS.

- ✅ Dockerization for easy deployment.
